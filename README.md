## Revised Portfolio

## Technologies used:
Using Codepen code, path, express local server, Node Package Manager, Heroku, Google Fonts, Bootstrap and visual studio code.

The purpose of this portfolio update was to implement newly learned lessons on routing, while cleaning up our previous portfolios by adding a new project that I had just completed to the portfolio section. 

Crafting up the new portfolio was also a personal excercise in researching component templates and pieces outside of just Bootstrap. I spent hours going through Codepen finding components that I liked and strategizing how I could put them together to create a portolio that was unique to my vision as a developer and how I wanted to make myself stand out and prepresented to the outside world.

## What I learned:
 - How to research templates and gain an eye for what components would complement each other visually.
 - How to "think backwards". If there was conflicting CSS code from different components, I looked into which pieces were creating conflict and assigned unique IDs to avoid disruption.
 - How to set up routing for a personal website
 - Overcoming initial obstacles in setting up routes. Initially my local server was unable to find the file path that I was trying to set up.

## Steps
1.  Went to codepen to find eye-popping templates and to gather a bit of inspiration for what I wanted my portfolio to look like.
2. Selected a navigation bar that I loved and implemented it. Unfortunately the navbar was causing me issues due to floating so I had to scrap it later in the process.
3. Take a part of a template to use their "About Me" section which had nice structure along with a place to incluide a photo.
4. Added template for contact form.
5. Added bootstrap component I had used previously for slideshow of my projects.
6. Installed necessary packages to get my routes up and running. 
7. Went back to input a new navigation bar after having issues with my previous one.
7. Deployed final product to Heroku.
